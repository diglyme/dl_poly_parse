dl_poly_parse
=============

Parses the output (currently just physical properties) from DL_POLY into machine-readable formats.

If ran in a directory containing a DL_POLY OUTPUT file, will produce a PARSED file containing fixed-width columns of each property, for easy import into spreadsheet or plotting software.

Can also be used as a library to return lists of headers, single properties, or all properties as a list of lists.
